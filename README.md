This should work on Linux.
## Building
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Platypus-Tech/ppc.git
cd ppc
gcc ppc.c -o ppc # you can use any compiler you want, like cc or clang, just as long as you can use it.
```
I know it's ironic that you still have to `GCC` or `CC` it, I have yet to implement `Makefile`s.
