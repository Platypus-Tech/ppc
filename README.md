OMG THAT LOOKS LIKE A DEFORMED STORK, IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE A PIGEON WITH A POTATO BODY.

## About
This compiler is in alpha stage, and is going to be able to compile C, C++, D, etc. Here's the direct order of what I want to do those in:
1. C
2. C++
3. D
4. C#
5. Ada
## Building
This should work on Linux.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Platypus-Tech/ppc.git
cd ppc
gcc ppc.c -o ppc # you can use any compiler you want, like cc or clang, just as long as you can use it.
```
I know it's ironic that you still have to `GCC` or `CC` it, I have yet to implement `Makefile`s.
